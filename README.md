#Summary
- Creates an Azure resource group, virtual network, and subnet, and prompts the user to select a region.
- Sets up a private endpoint with a private DNS zone and associates it with the created virtual network and subnet.
- Links the private DNS zone to the virtual network for DNS resolution within the virtual network.
#
The Terraform main.tf configuration file sets up the following resources in Azure for a Function App:
- A resource group
- A virtual network and subnet
- A private DNS zone
- A private endpoint with a private service connection to the target Azure resource
- A link between the private DNS zone and the virtual network
#
- The `variables.tfvars.example` file provides example values for variables such as location, resource group name, private endpoint name, target resource ID, and more.
- These resources and configurations are used to securely connect an Azure Function App to other Azure services via a private endpoint, leveraging private DNS for name resolution.
These resources ensure that the Function App can securely connect to other Azure services via a private endpoint, leveraging private DNS for name resolution.
